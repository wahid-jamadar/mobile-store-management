# 📱 Mobile Store Management System

The **Mobile Store Management System** is a console-based Java application. It is designed to manage mobile store inventory and generate customer bills using core Java features like Object-Oriented Programming, File Handling, Exception Handling, and Object Serialization.

- ✅ **Bill Generation**: Creates a new bill for each transaction and appends it to `bills.txt`.
- ✅ **Object Serialization**: Saves and retrieves inventory data without using an external database.
- ✅ **Exception Handling**: Catches invalid inputs and file-related errors for smooth execution.
- ✅ **Single-File Structure**: Entire logic is implemented in one Java file for simplicity.
